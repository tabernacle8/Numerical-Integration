### Cool Integration Calculator

## Ok so I got bored in math and wanted a program to run a few integral formulas for me. Well, this is the finished project after a few hours and it seems to work great!

### This calculator can do simpsons, trepezoidal, and midpoint rules accurately to 9 decimal places
### Just run the right file and change the variables at the top. Have fun!
